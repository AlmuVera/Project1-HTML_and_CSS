# Nomness - Simple and Delicious Recipes
Welcome to Nomness! This is a project I completed as part of a Udacity course using HTML, CSS, and a bit of additional JavaScript I added myself. The project's goal was to create a personal blog, and I decided to create a cooking recipe website.

## Project Description
Nomness is a website dedicated to sharing simple yet delicious recipes. It is designed with a clear and accessible structure, featuring several pages for better navigation:

- **Home Page:** The main page where the latest and featured recipes are presented.

- **About Page:** A page where I share the story and purpose of Nomness.

- **Contact Page:** A page with a contact form for users to send their comments and questions.

- **Subscription Form:** A form that allows users to subscribe to receive updates and new recipes directly in their email.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.

- **CSS3:** For styles and design.

- **JavaScript:** For additional functionalities and improved user interaction.

## Additional Features
- **JavaScript:** I added some JavaScript to enhance user interaction, including validation for the contact and subscription forms.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes from mobile devices to desktops.
