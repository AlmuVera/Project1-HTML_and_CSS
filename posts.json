Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Reduce heat and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Add a cornstarch slurry to thicken, stirring constantly. Set aside.\n\nPlace salmon fillets in a dish and pour half of the teriyaki sauce over them to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).\n\nHeat vegetable oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear salmon fillets, skin-side up, for 2-3 minutes until browned. Flip and transfer skillet to the oven. Bake for 8-10 minutes until cooked through.\n\nFor the stir-fried vegetables, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Stir-fry onion until softened. Add minced garlic, grated ginger, julienned carrots, broccoli florets, snap peas, and bell peppers. Stir-fry for 4-5 minutes until tender-crisp. Add soy sauce, oyster sauce (optional), and sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nTo serve, brush baked salmon with reserved teriyaki sauce. Plate stir-fried vegetables and place salmon fillets on top. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Serve immediately.\n\nThis recipe serves 4 people. Adjust quantities as needed for larger or smaller servings."        }
